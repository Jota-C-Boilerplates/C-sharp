## Overview
The class contains several members: a field named _top, two methods named Push and Pop, and a nested class named Entry. The Entry class further contains three members: a property named Next, a property named Data, and a constructor. The Stack is a generic class. It has one type parameter, T that is replaced with a concrete type when it's used.

A stack is a "first in - last out" (FILO) collection. New elements are added to the top of the stack. When an element is removed, it's removed from the top of the stack. The previous example declares the Stack type that defines the storage and behavior for a stack. You can declare a variable that refers to an instance of the Stack type to use that functionality.
